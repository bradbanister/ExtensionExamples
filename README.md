# ExtensionExamples

The Ed-Fi Data Standard and related technologies can be extended to add new entities and elements. The set of standard extensions are codified in the Ed-Fi Extension Framework, documented herein. Potential extensions and modifications may be categorized into the following categories:

- Extension Framework: Extensions included in this category are allowed and fully endorsed. 

- Prohibited Modifications: Prohibited modifications are modifications or extensions to the Ed-Fi model that are not permitted or are strongly discouraged. Typically, prohibited modifications involve making changes directly to the core Ed-Fi data model.

- Unsupported Extensions: Unsupported extensions include extensions that are not fully supported by the Ed-Fi technology. These scenarios are not explicitly prohibited, but are discouraged due to known issues that prevent their use in certain scenarios.

- Upcoming Improvements: This category includes otherwise valid extension scenarios for which there are known issues preventing their use. These issues will generally be addressed in a future version.


Folders for each of these four categories have been included, each containing sample MetaEd projects illustrating the extensions and modifications included in the category. 

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
