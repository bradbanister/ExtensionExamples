# ExtendingExistingEntities

The extension of domain entities and associations is endorsed as a rule, despite some known issues that may be encountered. These issues will generally be addressed in a future version.

A folder has been included for each type of extendable entity for which there are known issues. Each folder contains sample MetaEd projects illustrating the issues.
