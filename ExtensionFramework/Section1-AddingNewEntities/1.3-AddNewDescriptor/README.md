# AddNewDescriptor

Descriptors are a customizable list of values mapped for each implementation.

Sample MetaEd projects have been included illustrating the requirements that must be followed, as well as any property types that may be included.

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
