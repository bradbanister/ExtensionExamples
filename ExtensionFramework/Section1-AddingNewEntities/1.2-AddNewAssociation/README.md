Association entities usually make a logical connection between domain entities (e.g., between a staff member and an education organization to which they are assigned). In the Ed-Fi data model, Association entities almost always carry additional information about the association itself such as begin and end dates. Associations often carry information specific to the association such as a staff member's specific role at a particular school.

Sample MetaEd projects have been included illustrating the requirements that must be followed, as well as any property types that may be included.

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
