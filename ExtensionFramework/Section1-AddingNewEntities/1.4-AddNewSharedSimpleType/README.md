# AddNewSharedSimpleType

Shared simple types are elements that can be reused throughout an extension.

A sample MetaEd project has been included illustrating the requirements that must be followed.

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
