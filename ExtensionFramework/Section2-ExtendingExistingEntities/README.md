# ExtendingExistingEntities

Entities of the following types may be extended:
- Domain Entities
- Associations
- Interchanges

A folder has been included for each type of entity that may be extended. Each folder contains sample MetaEd projects illustrating the requirements that must be followed for each entity type, as well as any property types that may be included.

The extension of the above listed types of entities is endorsed as a rule, despite known issues that may be encountered while extending particular domain entities or associations. These issues are summarized in the UpcomingImprovements section of this repository and include:
- Extending the School domain entity
- Extending the Staff domain entity
- Extending the Parent domain entity
- Extending the StudentProgramAssociation association entity or any of its subclasses

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
