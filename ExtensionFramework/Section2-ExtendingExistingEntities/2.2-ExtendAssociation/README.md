# ExtendAssociation

An existing association entity such as the StudentParentAssociation entity can be extended to add new elements.

Sample MetaEd projects have been included illustrating the requirements that must be followed, as well as any property types that may be included.

The extension of associations is endorsed as a rule, despite known issues that may be encountered. These issues are summarized in the UpcomingImprovements section of this repository.

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
