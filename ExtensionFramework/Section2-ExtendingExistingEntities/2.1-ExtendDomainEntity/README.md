# ExtendDomainEntity

An existing domain entity such as a Student or an Education Organization can be extended to add new elements.

Sample MetaEd projects have been included illustrating the requirements that must be followed, as well as any property types that may be included.

The extension of entities is endorsed as a rule, despite known issues that may be encountered while extending particular domain entities. These issues are summarized in the UpcomingImprovements section of this repository and include:
- Extending the School domain entity
- Extending the Staff domain entity
- Extending the Parent domain entity

Note that the examples provided are illustrative only of supported extension activities and are not designed to serve as examples of properly modeled extension projects.
